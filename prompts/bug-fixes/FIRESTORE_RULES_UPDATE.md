# Firestore Rules Update - 2023

## Issues Fixed

The Firestore rules were updated to address several deprecated functions and syntax issues:

1. **Replaced `containsKey` with modern syntax**
   - Changed all instances of `data.containsKey('field')` to `'field' in data`
   - This improves compatibility with newer Firestore Rules versions

2. **Removed unused functions**
   - Removed `isValidStringArray` function that was declared but never used
   - Removed `isArrayOfStringsWithinLength` function that was only referenced by the above
   - Removed `isLimitedUpdate` function that was no longer being used
   - Removed `rateLimitInviteCodeAccess` function from invite code rules

3. **Fixed query syntax**
   - Updated invalid `request.query.where("landlordId", "==", request.auth.uid)` to the correct format:
     `request.query == {"landlordId": request.auth.uid}`
   - This follows the proper structure for query conditions in security rules

## Benefits

These updates ensure:

- Clean compilation of rules with no warnings
- Better performance by removing unused code
- Improved compatibility with latest Firestore syntax
- Increased security by using proper query validation

## Testing

The rules have been tested and deployed successfully to Firebase. All previous functionality is maintained with the corrected syntax.

## Future Recommendations

1. Regularly review security rules for deprecated functions
2. Consider adding automated tests for security rules
3. Further optimize rule functions by removing redundant code
