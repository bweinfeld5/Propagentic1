# PropAgentic Data Persistence & Account Security Fix PRD

## Problem Statement

**Critical Issue**: Landlord property data does not persist after logout/login cycle, and user names are not displaying securely in the dashboard header. This breaks the core user experience and indicates potential security vulnerabilities in data association and authentication flows.

**Impact**: 
- Data loss erodes user trust and platform reliability
- Potential security vulnerabilities with user data isolation
- Poor user experience with missing personalization
- Possible cross-user data access issues

## Current State Analysis

**Symptoms Observed:**
1. Landlord creates account and successfully logs in
2. Landlord adds property through AddPropertyModal
3. Property appears in dashboard during session
4. Landlord logs out
5. Upon re-login, property data is missing
6. User name not displaying in dashboard header

**Technical Stack:**
- Frontend: React 18 + TypeScript + Firebase SDK
- Backend: Firebase Auth + Firestore + Security Rules
- State Management: React Context API (AuthContext)
- Data Layer: dataService.js with real-time subscriptions

## Root Cause Investigation Areas

### 1. Authentication & User Profile System
**Potential Issues:**
- User document not created in Firestore during registration
- Missing or incorrect userType/role assignment ('landlord')
- Incomplete user profile data structure
- Authentication state not persisting across sessions
- Profile loading race conditions

**Technical Components:**
- Firebase Auth registration flow
- AuthContext user profile management
- User document creation in Firestore
- Session persistence and recovery

### 2. Property Data Creation Flow
**Potential Issues:**
- landlordId not properly assigned to property documents
- Firestore write operations failing silently
- Security rules blocking property creation
- Data service errors not surfaced to UI
- Transaction rollbacks or partial writes

**Technical Components:**
- AddPropertyModal form handling
- dataService.createProperty method
- Firestore security rules validation
- Error handling and user feedback

### 3. Property Data Retrieval System
**Potential Issues:**
- Query filters not matching user association
- Real-time listeners not configured correctly
- Race conditions in data loading
- Cache invalidation problems
- Subscription cleanup issues

**Technical Components:**
- loadDashboardData function
- subscribeToProperties implementation
- Query filters and user association
- Real-time listener lifecycle management

### 4. Security Rules & Data Isolation
**Potential Issues:**
- Properties collection rules too restrictive
- isPropertyOwner function logic errors
- Cross-user data access vulnerabilities
- Rule evaluation performance issues
- Missing validation functions

**Technical Components:**
- Firestore security rules (firestore.rules)
- Property access validation functions
- User role verification
- Data isolation enforcement

### 5. Frontend State Management
**Potential Issues:**
- AuthContext not properly loading user profile
- currentUser state not persisting
- Property state management in LandlordDashboard
- Loading states and error handling gaps
- Context provider ordering issues

**Technical Components:**
- AuthContext implementation
- User profile loading and caching
- Dashboard state management
- Error boundary handling

## Success Criteria

### Primary Goals
1. **Data Persistence**: Properties must persist after logout/login cycle
2. **Security**: Users can only access their own data with zero cross-contamination
3. **User Experience**: Display name shows correctly in dashboard header
4. **Reliability**: Robust error handling prevents silent failures

### Technical Requirements
1. **Authentication Flow**: Complete user document creation on registration
2. **Data Association**: Proper landlordId assignment to all property documents
3. **Query Filters**: Correct user-scoped data retrieval
4. **Security Rules**: Validated and tested Firestore rules
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting and user feedback

### Testing Requirements
1. **End-to-End Testing**: Complete user journey from registration to property management
2. **Security Testing**: Verify data isolation between users
3. **Edge Case Testing**: Handle network failures, partial writes, and race conditions
4. **Performance Testing**: Ensure queries and rules perform efficiently

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Diagnostic Investigation
1. **Trace Registration Flow**: Verify user document creation and profile setup
2. **Monitor Property Creation**: Track data flow from UI to Firestore
3. **Analyze Query Execution**: Examine property retrieval and filtering
4. **Validate Security Rules**: Test rule enforcement and performance
5. **Audit State Management**: Review context providers and state flow

### Phase 2: Issue Resolution
1. **Fix Authentication Issues**: Ensure complete user profile creation
2. **Resolve Data Association**: Guarantee proper landlordId assignment
3. **Optimize Queries**: Improve data retrieval and filtering
4. **Strengthen Security**: Validate and fix security rules
5. **Enhance Error Handling**: Add comprehensive error reporting

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation
1. **Manual Testing**: Execute complete test protocol
2. **Automated Testing**: Add unit and integration tests
3. **Security Validation**: Verify data isolation and access controls
4. **Performance Optimization**: Ensure efficient data operations

## Technical Architecture

### Data Models
```typescript
interface User {
  uid: string;
  email: string;
  userType: 'landlord' | 'tenant' | 'admin';
  firstName?: string;
  lastName?: string;
  displayName?: string;
  createdAt: Timestamp;
  updatedAt: Timestamp;
}

interface Property {
  id: string;
  landlordId: string; // Must match user.uid
  name: string;
  address: {
    street: string;
    city: string;
    state: string;
    zipCode: string;
  };
  propertyType: string;
  createdAt: Timestamp;
  updatedAt: Timestamp;
}
```

### Security Rules Requirements
```javascript
// Properties collection rules
match /properties/{propertyId} {
  allow read, write: if isSignedIn() && 
    (isLandlord() && resource.data.landlordId == request.auth.uid);
  allow create: if isSignedIn() && isLandlord() && 
    request.resource.data.landlordId == request.auth.uid;
}
```

## Testing Protocol

### Test Cases
1. **Fresh Account Creation**: New user registration and immediate property addition
2. **Multi-Property Management**: Multiple properties per user
3. **Cross-User Isolation**: Verify users cannot access others' data
4. **Session Persistence**: Logout/login cycles with data verification
5. **Error Scenarios**: Network failures, invalid data, security violations

### Validation Steps
1. Create test account with unique email
2. Verify user document in Firestore console
3. Add property and monitor network requests
4. Confirm property document creation with correct landlordId
5. Clear browser data and log out completely
6. Log back in and verify property persistence
7. Check user name display in dashboard header
8. Test with multiple users to verify data isolation

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Data Loss**: Critical user data not persisting
2. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Potential cross-user data access
3. **User Trust**: Platform reliability concerns
4. **Scalability**: Query performance with growing data

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Comprehensive Testing**: Thorough validation before deployment
2. **Error Monitoring**: Real-time error tracking and alerting
3. **Rollback Plan**: Ability to revert changes if issues arise
4. **User Communication**: Clear messaging about any service interruptions
