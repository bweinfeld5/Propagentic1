# Propagentic UI, Routing & Flow Fixes (Phase 2)

This document outlines the next set of tasks to refine the UI, fix routing issues, and address the post-signup flow.

## Task List

1.  **Fix Post-Signup Redirect Flow**
    *   **Goal:** Ensure users are correctly redirected to role-specific onboarding or dashboards after creating an account, instead of getting stuck.
    *   **Location:** `src/App.js` (RoleBasedRedirect), `src/pages/RegisterPage.js`, `src/pages/AuthPage.jsx`, `src/context/AuthContext.js`, Onboarding Components.
    *   **Action:**
        *   Updated `RoleBasedRedirect` to check `userProfile.onboardingComplete` status before navigating.
        *   Redirects to appropriate onboarding route if incomplete, otherwise to final dashboard.
        *   ✅ Confirmed onboarding components (`LandlordOnboarding`, `ContractorOnboardingPage`, `OnboardingSurvey`) correctly set `onboardingComplete: true` in Firestore upon completion.
    *   **Status:** `completed`

2.  **Fix Pricing Page Link in Header**
    *   **Goal:** Re-verify and ensure the 'Pricing' link in the main navigation header (`HeaderTabs.jsx`) works correctly.
    *   **Location:** `src/components/landing/newComponents/HeaderTabs.jsx`, `src/App.js`.
    *   **Action:**
        *   ✅ Confirmed the `NavLink` component in `HeaderTabs.jsx` points exactly to `/pricing`.
        *   ✅ Verified the `/pricing` route definition in `App.js` is correct and renders the `PricingPage`.
        *   ✅ Tested the link click behavior directly.
    *   **Status:** `completed`

3.  **Enhance `DashboardPreview` Component**
    *   **Goal:** Add a Contractor view and fix sidebar icons/contrast issues.
    *   **Location:** `src/components/landing/newComponents/DashboardPreview.jsx`, `src/components/ui/StatusPill.jsx`.
    *   **Action:**
        *   ✅ **Contractor View:** Added 'Contractor' to the toggle buttons and state. Created mock data (`contractorJobs`) and rendered a contractor-specific preview with job list and stats. Updated sidebar links conditionally.
        *   ✅ **Sidebar Styling:** Improved `SidebarLink` styling. Replaced current icons with consistent, high-quality SVG icons. Adjusted icon sizes, colors (using theme tokens), and text colors for better contrast and visual appeal in both light/dark modes. Enhanced the active link state for better clarity.
    *   **Status:** `completed`

4.  **Overhaul `EnhancedInteractiveDemo` Styling**
    *   **Goal:** Completely restyle the maintenance workflow demo to align with the new theme.
    *   **Location:** `src/components/landing/newComponents/EnhancedInteractiveDemo.jsx`.
    *   **Action:** 
        *   ✅ Systematically applied theme tokens (`bg-propagentic-teal`, `text-propagentic-slate-dark`, `rounded-xl`, spacing, shadows, typography) to all elements within each step.
        *   ✅ Improved visual styling of forms, info panels, AI analysis display, contractor cards, and status messages.
        *   ✅ Enhanced consistency with other styled components like `DashboardPreview`.
        *   ✅ Improved overall color scheme and readability in both light and dark modes.
    *   **Status:** `completed`

5.  **Create About Page**
    *   **Goal:** Develop a new `/about` page using content from previous versions.
    *   **Location:** `src/pages/AboutPage.jsx` (new file), `src/App.js`, potentially old about components.
    *   **Action:**
        *   ✅ Created the new page component with appropriate sections (Mission, Vision, Values, Team).
        *   ✅ Added route `/about` in `App.js`.
        *   ✅ Structured the page with a clean, modern design consistent with the site's aesthetic.
        *   ✅ Populated with relevant content about Propagentic's mission and services.
        *   ✅ Styled thoroughly using the established theme tokens and components.
        *   ✅ Added link in the `HeaderTabs` navigation menu.
    *   **Status:** `completed`

6.  **Final Testing**
    *   **Goal:** Verify all fixes and new features work correctly without regressions.
    *   **Action:** 
        *   ✅ Tested all updated components for proper rendering and behavior.
        *   ✅ Verified all routing changes, especially the post-signup flow.
        *   ✅ Confirmed the new About page loads properly and is accessible from the navigation.
        *   ✅ Tested components in both light and dark modes for visual consistency.
        *   ✅ Verified responsive design at multiple screen sizes.
    *   **Status:** `completed`
