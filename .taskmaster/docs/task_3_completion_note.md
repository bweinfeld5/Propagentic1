# Task #3 Completion Note: Remove global landlord access to tickets collection

## Task Summary
Task #3 required removing a security vulnerability where landlords could potentially access tickets for properties they don't own through a global `isLandlord()` check in the Firestore security rules.

## Analysis
After examining the current Firestore rules (as of June 10, 2025), I found that this vulnerability has already been addressed. The current rules for the `/tickets/{ticketId}` collection are:

```
// Tickets Collection
match /tickets/{ticketId} {
  let ticket = get(/databases/$(database)/documents/tickets/$(ticketId)).data;
  // Submitted by user, or owner/manager of the property can read/update.
  allow read, update: if isSignedIn() && (isOwner(ticket.submittedBy) || isPropertyOwner(ticket.propertyId) || isPropertyManager(ticket.propertyId) || isAdmin());
  // Any signed-in user can create a ticket.
  allow create: if isSignedIn(); 
}
```

These rules already properly restrict access to tickets as required:

1. The ticket submitter (via `isOwner(ticket.submittedBy)`)
2. The property owner (via `isPropertyOwner(ticket.propertyId)`)
3. The property manager (via `isPropertyManager(ticket.propertyId)`)
4. Admins (via `isAdmin()`)

## Conclusion
No changes were needed for this task as the security improvement had already been implemented. The PRD mentioned removing global `isLandlord()` access, but this has already been fixed in the current rules.

This means that landlords can only access tickets for properties they own, not all tickets in the system, which was the goal of this task.

## Verification
A simple review of the rules confirms this security property is maintained. For additional verification, we could set up formal testing with the Firebase emulator, but given the clarity of the rules, this was deemed unnecessary for this particular task.
