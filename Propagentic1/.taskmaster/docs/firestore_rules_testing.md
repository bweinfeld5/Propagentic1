# Firestore Rules Testing Framework - Implementation Notes

## Task #4: Set up Jest test framework for Firestore rules

This document outlines the implementation of a comprehensive Jest testing framework for Firestore security rules, completed as part of Task #4.

## Framework Components

### 1. Test Infrastructure

We've set up a complete testing infrastructure with the following components:

- **Test Helper Utilities**: `test/helpers/firestore-test-utils.js` provides common functions for setting up test environments, creating test data, and managing authenticated contexts.

- **Jest Configuration**: Updated `jest.config.js` with proper configuration for Firestore rules testing, including appropriate test matching patterns, timeouts, and reporting options.

- **Test Setup**: Created `test/setup/jest.setup.js` which handles global setup for tests, including checking if the Firebase emulator is running and silencing console output during tests unless debug mode is enabled.

### 2. Test Scripts

Added several npm scripts to package.json for running different types of tests:

```json
"test": "jest",
"test:watch": "jest --watch",
"test:coverage": "jest --coverage",
"test:rules": "jest \"test/firestore/.*\\.test\\.js\"",
"test:users": "jest test/firestore/users.test.js",
"test:properties": "jest test/firestore/properties.test.js",
"test:invites": "jest test/firestore/invites.test.js",
"test:prelaunch": "node test-prelaunch-collections.js",
"test:debug": "cross-env TEST_DEBUG=true jest",
"emulators:start": "firebase emulators:start",
"emulators:test": "firebase emulators:exec --only firestore 'npm test'",
"emulators:test:rules": "firebase emulators:exec --only firestore 'npm run test:rules'",
"emulators:test:debug": "firebase emulators:exec --only firestore 'npm run test:debug'"
```

These scripts allow running specific tests or test groups with various options.

### 3. Test Files

Created sample test files to demonstrate how to test different Firestore collections:

- `test/firestore/properties.test.js`: Tests for property collection access rules
- `test/firestore/invites.test.js`: Tests for invite collection access rules
- `test/firestore/users.test.js`: (Existing file) Tests for user collection access rules

### 4. Documentation

Created detailed documentation for the testing framework:

- `test/README.md`: Comprehensive guide on how to use and extend the testing framework
- `.taskmaster/docs/firestore_rules_testing.md` (this file): Implementation notes for Task #4

## Testing Approach

The testing framework follows these key principles:

1. **Isolation**: Each test is independent, with a clean database state before each test.
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests verify both allowed and denied operations for different user roles.
3. **Realistic Test Data**: Tests use realistic data structures that match the actual application data.
4. **Edge Cases**: Tests cover edge cases like users trying to access unauthorized resources.
5. **Helper Functions**: Common operations are abstracted into helper functions to reduce duplication.

## Using the Framework

To use the testing framework:

1. Start the Firebase emulator:
   ```bash
   npm run emulators:start
   ```

2. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   npm run test:rules
   ```

3. For development workflow, use watch mode:
   ```bash
   npm run test:watch
   ```

4. For debugging, use debug mode:
   ```bash
   npm run test:debug
   ```

## Test Example

Here's an example of a test from the framework:

```javascript
test('Landlord can read their own property', async () => {
  const landlordAuth = getUserWithType(testEnv, landlordUser.uid, 'landlord');
  const propertyRef = doc(landlordAuth.firestore(), 'properties', propertyData.id);
  
  await assertSucceeds(getDoc(propertyRef));
});
```

This test verifies that a landlord can read a property they own, using the `getUserWithType` helper to create an authenticated context with the 'landlord' role.

## Future Improvements

Potential future improvements to the testing framework:

1. **CI Integration**: Add integration with CI/CD pipeline to run tests automatically.
2. **Test Coverage Reports**: Generate and track test coverage over time.
3. **Visual Reporting**: Add visual reports for test results.
4. **Expanded Test Suites**: Add more test files for other collections and edge cases.
5. **Performance Testing**: Add tests for rules performance to ensure efficient queries.

## Conclusion

The Jest testing framework for Firestore rules provides a robust way to verify that security rules are working as expected. It allows for comprehensive testing of all read and write operations against different collections, with different user roles and authentication states.

By running these tests regularly, we can ensure that security rules continue to protect data appropriately as the application evolves.
