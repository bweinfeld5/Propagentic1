## Installation Guide

To implement all the features in this plan, you'll need to install the following packages:

```bash
# UI and animation packages
npm install framer-motion

# Chart and visualization packages
npm install chart.js react-chartjs-2

# Interactive component packages
npm install react-beautiful-dnd react-joyride

# Map visualization
npm install react-simple-maps

# Date handling (optional but useful)
npm install date-fns
```

## Recommended Implementation Order

For the most effective implementation process, focus on these tasks in sequence:

1. **Fix critical navigation issues first** - This ensures the application is fundamentally usable before adding enhancements.

2. **Create the shared component library** - Building StatusBadge, buttons, and other reusable components will save time later.

3. **Enhance the core dashboard UI** - Improve the visual appearance of existing elements before adding new interactive features.

4. **Add basic charting** - Implement simple charts before moving to more complex interactive features.

5. **Implement advanced interactivity** - Add drag-and-drop and other complex interactions after the basic UI is solid.

6. **Polish with animations and transitions** - Add these enhancement layers last, once the core functionality is working.

## Key Deliverables

1. **Enhanced Navigation System** - Seamless flow between all application pages with proper transition animations.

2. **Consistent UI Design System** - Common color palette, typography, and component styles across all pages.

3. **Interactive Dashboard** - Dashboard with drag-and-drop functionality, expandable elements, and interactive charts.

4. **Visual Data Representations** - Charts, maps, and visual indicators of property and maintenance statuses.

5. **Guided Demo Experience** - Interactive tour highlighting key features for new users.

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to enhancing the PropAgentic application while ensuring all user requirements are met within a reasonable timeframe.
