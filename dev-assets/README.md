# Development Assets Directory

This directory contains files that were moved from the project root to improve organization while maintaining functionality.

## ðŸ“‚ Directory Structure

### `templates/` - Template Files
Template files that are not actively referenced in the codebase:
- `App.js.template`
- `HeroSection.tsx.template`
- `LandingPage.tsx.template`
- `RoleSelector.tsx.template`
- `landing.css.template`

**Status**: âœ… Safe to move - These templates are not referenced by any build tools or scripts.

### `test-files/` - Test HTML Files
HTML files used for manual testing and debugging:
- `test-email-manual.html`
- `test-firebase-direct.html`
- `test-firestore-direct.html`
- `test-minimal-waitlist.html`
- `test-ui-showcase.html`
- `test-waitlist-fixed.html`
- `route-test.html`

**Status**: âœ… Safe to move - These are standalone test files not referenced by automated tests.

### `backups/` - Backup Files
Backup and duplicate configuration files:
- `.firebaserc 2` - Duplicate Firebase config
- `.env.backup` - Environment backup
- `.env.backup.20250701_091804` - Timestamped environment backup
- `firestore.rules.save` - Firestore rules backup

**Status**: âœ… Safe to move - These are backup files not used by active processes.

### `data-files/` - Data and Configuration Files
Miscellaneous data files not actively used:
- `files-to-remove.txt` - List of files to remove
- `environment.json` - Environment configuration (not referenced)
- `extension.env` - Extension environment file (not referenced)

**Status**: âœ… Safe to move - These files are not referenced by active tools or scripts.

## ðŸ”’ Files That CANNOT Be Moved

The following files **must remain in the project root** because tools expect them there:

### Essential Configuration
- **Environment**: `.env`, `.env.demo`, `.env.development`, `.env.example`, `.env.production`
- **Package Management**: `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `.npmrc`, `.yarnrc.yml`
- **Build Tools**: `tsconfig.json`, `tailwind.config.js`, `.babelrc.js`, `eslint.config.mjs`
- **Testing**: `jest.config.js`, `vitest.config.ts`, `playwright.config.js`
- **Git**: `.gitignore`
- **Deployment**: `vercel.json`, `.vercelignore`, `serve.json`

### Firebase Configuration
- `.firebaserc`, `firebase.json`
- `firestore.rules`, `firestore.indexes.json`, `storage.rules`
- `firestore.debug.rules` (used by debug deployment scripts)
- `firebase-temp.json` (used by emulator setup scripts)

### Tool-Specific Configurations
- `.taskmasterconfig` (TaskMaster expects this in root)
- `.windsurfrules` (Windsurf IDE expects this in root)
- `.roomodes` (Roo tool expects this in root)
- `components.json` (UI component tools expect this in root)

### Referenced Data Files
These files are referenced by tools and scripts:
- `email-cleanup-report.json` (used by `tools/maintenance/email-cleanup-agent.js`)
- `test-landlord-profile-data.json` (used by `tools/testing/test-existing-landlord-profile.js`)
- `user-audit-full.json` (used by `tools/analysis/audit-current-users.js`)
- `user-audit-summary.txt` (used by `tools/analysis/audit-current-users.js`)
- `users-to-delete.json` (used by `tools/analysis/audit-current-users.js`)
- `package-functions-test.json` (referenced in testing documentation)

### Generated Files
- `playwright-report.json` (generated by Playwright, configured in `playwright.config.js`)
- `results.xml` (generated by Playwright, configured in `playwright.config.js`)

## âœ… Benefits of This Organization

1. **Cleaner Root Directory** - Essential configuration files are more visible
2. **Better Organization** - Related files are grouped together
3. **Maintained Functionality** - All tools and scripts continue to work as expected
4. **Clear Separation** - Development assets are separated from production configuration

## ðŸ”„ Adding New Files

When adding new files to the project:

### Add to Root If:
- Required by build tools, package managers, or deployment systems
- Configuration files that tools expect in specific locations
- Files that need to be accessed by relative paths from multiple locations

### Add to `dev-assets/` If:
- Template files for development reference
- Test files for manual debugging
- Backup copies of configuration files
- Development data that's not referenced by automated tools

## ðŸ“‹ Restoration

If you need to restore any moved files to the root directory:

```bash
# Restore templates
cp dev-assets/templates/* ./

# Restore test files  
cp dev-assets/test-files/* ./

# Restore backups
cp dev-assets/backups/* ./

# Restore data files
cp dev-assets/data-files/* ./
```

**Note**: This organization was done with careful analysis to ensure no functionality was broken. All moved files were verified to not be referenced by active tools, scripts, or build processes.
