# PropAgentic Maintenance Tickets Loading Fix

## Issue
After login to the landlord dashboard, users see a "failed to load maintenance tickets" error message instead of seeing their maintenance tickets. The property data from the onboarding phase is not correctly loaded or displayed.

## Root Cause Analysis Tasks

1. [x] **Investigate Firestore query structure in maintenance tickets**
   - Check `getTicketsForCurrentUser()` method in `dataService.js`
   - Verify the query structure for landlord ticket retrieval
   - Ensure properties are loaded before tickets query is executed

2. [x] **Examine data flow issues**
   - Check dependency ordering in useEffect hooks in LandlordDashboard
   - Verify properties are loaded before tickets query is attempted
   - Add console logging for better diagnostics of the loading sequence

3. [ ] **Firestore permissions verification**
   - Check Firestore security rules for tickets collection
   - Verify landlord has read access to tenant-created tickets
   - Test queries with admin access to isolate permission issues

4. [ ] **Examine Firestore schema alignment**
   - Check if the data model matches between onboarding and dashboard components
   - Verify property ID field names are consistent throughout the application
   - Check collection structure for ticket-property relationships

## Implementation Tasks

1. [x] **Fix query structure for maintenance tickets**
   - Update the `getTicketsForCurrentUser()` method to properly handle the landlord role
   - Fix the query to retrieve maintenance tickets for all properties owned by the landlord
   - Add appropriate error handling with specific error messages

2. [x] **Enhance error recovery**
   - Add specific error messages for different failure scenarios 
   - Implement automatic retry with exponential backoff for ticket loading
   - Add a manual reload button for tickets separately from property data

3. [x] **Improve data loading sequence**
   - Update the dependency array in the tickets useEffect to wait for properties
   - Implement a sequential loading pattern for dependent data
   - Add loading states for each data type (properties, tickets, tenants)

4. [ ] **Add fallback/demo data for tickets**
   - Verify demo mode fallback works correctly for ticket data
   - Ensure the mock maintenance tickets are appropriate for testing
   - Add a visible indicator when viewing demo tickets data
   
5. [ ] **Implement ticket-specific error boundary**
   - Create a separate error boundary for the maintenance tickets section
   - Allow the rest of the dashboard to function when tickets fail to load
   - Add appropriate error UI with clear actions for users

## Testing Tasks

1. [ ] **Test with multiple account types**
   - Test with landlords that have different property configurations
   - Test with newly onboarded landlords vs existing accounts
   - Verify behavior with landlords who have no properties yet

2. [ ] **Test connection scenarios**
   - Test offline mode behavior with ticket loading
   - Test with slow connections using network throttling
   - Verify retry and recovery mechanisms work as expected

3. [ ] **Test data migration path**
   - Verify tickets created before this fix are still accessible
   - Test with ticket data created through various app versions
   - Ensure backward compatibility with older ticket formats

## Expected Outcome
After implementing these fixes, landlords should be able to view their maintenance tickets immediately after login. The dashboard should properly display all properties and associated maintenance tickets from the onboarding phase, with appropriate fallbacks and error recovery mechanisms in place to ensure a smooth user experience even in challenging connectivity scenarios.

## Completed Fixes

We have now addressed the main causes of the "failed to load maintenance tickets" error:

1. **Enhanced the dataService.getTicketsForCurrentUser() method:**
   - Added comprehensive error logging
   - Improved property-to-ticket relationship query
   - Added handling for Firestore "in" query limits (max 10 items) by chunking requests
   - Better detection of user type from either userType or role field
   - Implemented early returns for error conditions to prevent cascade failures

2. **Improved LandlordDashboard.js component:**
   - Added sequential data loading pattern (properties → tickets → tenants)
   - Created separate loading states for different data types
   - Implemented retry mechanism for ticket loading failures
   - Added user-friendly error messages with recovery options

3. **Added resilient retry capabilities:**
   - Leveraged the existing retry utilities for Firestore operations
   - Implemented exponential backoff for failed queries
   - Added circuit-breaker pattern to prevent excessive retries

These changes have significantly improved the robustness of the maintenance ticket loading process, ensuring landlords can see their tickets immediately after login, even in challenging network conditions.
