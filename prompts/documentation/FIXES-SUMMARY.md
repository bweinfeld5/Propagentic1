# PropAgentic Deployment Issues - Resolution Summary

## Issues Addressed

1. **Playwright Dependency Missing**
   - Error: `Cannot find module 'playwright'`
   - Fixed by installing Playwright and its dependencies with legacy peer dependencies flag

2. **Port Conflicts**
   - Error: `Something is already running on port 3000`
   - Created port management utility to automate handling of port conflicts

3. **Browser Testing Configuration**
   - Created setup script for Playwright testing environment
   - Added browser-tests directory for screenshots and test artifacts

## Tools Created

1. **`port-manager.js`**
   - Checks if a port is in use
   - Provides options to kill the process, use a different port, or exit
   - Updates .env files with the new port configuration

2. **`setup-playwright.js`**
   - Installs Playwright browsers and dependencies
   - Creates necessary directories
   - Sets up testing environment

3. **`DEPLOYMENT-README.md`**
   - Comprehensive documentation for deployment and troubleshooting
   - Instructions for handling common issues

## Package.json Updates

Added new npm scripts:
- `start:port`: Start with port management
- `start:alt`: Start on alternative port (3001)
- `port-check`: Run port manager utility
- `setup:playwright`: Run Playwright setup
- `test:integration`: Run integration tests

## Environment Configuration

- Created `.env.local` with PORT=3001 configuration
- Added documentation for customizing environment settings

## How to Use

### For Port Conflicts
```bash
# Check and manage ports
npm run port-check

# Start app with port management
npm run start:port

# Start on alternative port
npm run start:alt
```

### For Testing Setup
```bash
# Set up Playwright
npm run setup:playwright

# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration
```

## Next Steps Recommended

1. **Update CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Add port management to CI/CD workflow
   - Include Playwright setup in build process

2. **Browser Compatibility**
   - Run browser compatibility checks regularly
   - Address any issues identified by tests

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Run performance tests before deployment
   - Monitor application performance metrics
