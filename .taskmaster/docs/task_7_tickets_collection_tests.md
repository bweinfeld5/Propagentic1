# Task #7: Implement Tests for /tickets Collection Rules

## Overview

This task involved implementing comprehensive tests for the Firestore security rules protecting the `/tickets` collection. The tests verify that our security rules correctly enforce the role-based access control policies for maintenance tickets, ensuring proper access control, data validation, and workflow integrity.

## Test Coverage

The test suite is organized into distinct test groups covering different types of operations:

### Read Operations
- Verified tenants can read tickets they submitted
- Confirmed tenants cannot read tickets for properties they don't occupy
- Tested that landlords can only read tickets for properties they own
- Ensured property managers can read tickets for properties they manage
- Verified assigned contractors can only read tickets assigned to them
- Confirmed admins can read any ticket
- Validated that unauthenticated users cannot read any tickets

### Create Operations
- Confirmed tenants can create tickets for properties they occupy
- Verified tenants cannot create tickets for properties they don't occupy
- Tested that tenants cannot set submittedBy to a different user
- Ensured tenants cannot set system fields like status, contractorId, or createdAt
- Validated that landlords, contractors, and other non-tenant roles cannot create tickets
- Confirmed admins can create tickets for any property

### Update Operations
- Verified tenants can update certain fields (description, priority) of their own tickets
- Confirmed tenants cannot update tickets they didn't create
- Tested that landlords can update ticket status for their properties
- Ensured landlords cannot update tickets for properties they don't own
- Validated that property managers can update tickets for properties they manage
- Tested that assigned contractors can update status and progress of tickets assigned to them
- Confirmed contractors cannot update tickets not assigned to them
- Verified admins can update any ticket with any fields

### Delete Operations
- Confirmed no role (tenant, landlord, property manager, contractor, or admin) can delete tickets
- This ensures an audit trail of all maintenance issues and their resolutions

### Validation
- Verified ticket creation requires all mandatory fields (propertyId, submittedBy, category, description, priority)
- Confirmed critical fields like propertyId and submittedBy cannot be changed after creation

## Security Findings and Recommendations

Based on the test results, we've identified the following:

1. **Access Control**: The security rules correctly enforce access based on user roles and property associations. Tenants, landlords, property managers, and contractors can only access tickets relevant to them.

2. **Data Integrity**: The rules prevent unauthorized modifications to critical fields like propertyId and submittedBy, preserving the integrity of ticket ownership and property association.

3. **Audit Trail**: The prohibition on ticket deletion for all roles ensures a complete audit trail of maintenance issues.

4. **Field-Level Security**: The rules allow users to update only the fields appropriate for their role, maintaining proper workflow control.

5. **Potential Improvement**: Consider implementing more granular field-level validation for updates based on ticket status (e.g., preventing status changes from "completed" back to "in_progress").

## Implementation Notes

The tests leverage the Firebase Rules Unit Testing library and our custom test utilities to:

1. Create realistic test data modeling our production environment
2. Test each operation with different user roles
3. Verify both positive cases (allowed operations) and negative cases (denied operations)
4. Validate field-level access control

All tests are designed to run against the Firebase Local Emulator, providing a safe environment for security rule validation without affecting production data.

## Running the Tests

The tests can be run using the following npm scripts:

```bash
# Start the Firebase emulator and run the tests
npm run emulators:test:tickets

# Run just the tests (assuming emulator is already running)
npm run test:tickets
```

These tests should be run as part of the continuous integration process to ensure security rules remain effective as the application evolves.
