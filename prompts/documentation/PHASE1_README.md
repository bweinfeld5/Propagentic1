# Phase 1: Core Stability - Quick Start Guide

## 🚀 Getting Started

You are working on **Phase 1: Core Stability** improvements for the PropAgentic landlord dashboard. This branch focuses on fixing critical data persistence issues, adding property CRUD operations, implementing error handling, and improving loading states.

## 📋 Current Status

- **Branch**: `feature/phase1-core-stability`
- **Priority**: Critical data persistence issues need immediate attention
- **Estimated Timeline**: 1-2 weeks
- **Total Estimated Hours**: 62 hours

## 🎯 Main Objectives

1. **Fix Data Persistence Issues** (Critical Priority)
   - Resolve issues shown in the debug panel
   - Improve Firebase subscription reliability
   - Add connection state management

2. **Add Property CRUD Operations** (High Priority)
   - Create EditPropertyModal component
   - Add property deletion with confirmations
   - Update DataService with full CRUD

3. **Implement Error Boundaries** (High Priority)
   - Enhance existing ErrorBoundary
   - Add retry logic throughout the app
   - Create global error handling

4. **Add Loading States** (Medium Priority)
   - Create skeleton screen components
   - Replace spinners with skeletons
   - Improve user experience

## 📁 Key Files to Work With

### Critical Files (Start Here)
- `src/services/dataService.js` - Main data service needing reliability fixes
- `src/components/debug/DataPersistenceDiagnostic.jsx` - Shows current issues
- `src/pages/landlord/LandlordDashboard.tsx` - Main dashboard component

### New Files to Create
- `src/context/ConnectionContext.jsx` - Network state management
- `src/components/landlord/EditPropertyModal.jsx` - Property editing
- `src/components/ui/ConfirmationModal.jsx` - Delete confirmations
- `src/components/ui/Skeleton.jsx` - Loading skeletons
- `src/hooks/useRetry.js` - Retry logic hook
- `src/hooks/useLoadingStates.js` - Loading state management

## 🔧 Development Setup

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run start:fix
   ```

3. **Run type checking**:
   ```bash
   npm run typecheck
   ```

4. **Run tests**:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

## 🐛 Current Issues to Fix

Based on the debug panel, these are the main issues:

1. **Data Persistence Problems**:
   - Properties not loading consistently
   - Subscription failures
   - User profile sync issues

2. **Missing CRUD Operations**:
   - Can only CREATE properties, not edit/delete
   - No confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

3. **Poor Error Handling**:
   - Errors crash components
   - No retry mechanisms
   - Unclear error messages

4. **Loading Experience**:
   - Basic spinners instead of skeleton screens
   - No loading states for many operations

## 📖 Implementation Guide

Follow the detailed implementation guide in `PHASE1_CORE_STABILITY_GUIDE.md` for:
- Step-by-step code examples
- Component architecture
- Testing strategies
- Performance considerations

## ✅ Success Criteria

- [ ] Debug panel shows no data persistence issues
- [ ] Property edit/delete functionality works smoothly
- [ ] Error boundaries catch all errors gracefully
- [ ] Loading states provide clear user feedback
- [ ] No console errors in production build
- [ ] All TypeScript compilation passes
- [ ] User experience is smooth and responsive

## 🧪 Testing

Run these commands to verify your work:

```bash
# Type checking
npm run typecheck

# Linting
npm run lint

# Unit tests
npm test

# Build verification
npm run build
```

## 📞 Need Help?

- Check the comprehensive guide: `PHASE1_CORE_STABILITY_GUIDE.md`
- Review the agent configuration: `phase1-agent-config.json`
- Look at existing components in `src/components/` for patterns
- Check the debug panel in development for real-time issues

## 🎯 Next Steps After Phase 1

Once Phase 1 is complete, we'll move to Phase 2:
- Complete maintenance request workflow
- Add lease management functionality
- Implement rent tracking
- Add file upload capabilities
