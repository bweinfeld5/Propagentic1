# React Refresh Import Error Fix

## Problem
When running the development server, you encountered errors like:

```
ERROR in ./src/App.js 1:40-127
Module not found: Error: You attempted to import /Users/benweinfeld/Desktop/Propagentic/node_modules/react-refresh/runtime.js which falls outside of the project src/ directory. Relative imports outside of src/ are not supported.
```

These errors are related to React's Fast Refresh feature trying to import modules from outside the src/ directory, which Create React App doesn't allow.

## Solution

We've implemented two fixes:

1. **New Start Script**: Use the `start:fix` command to run the development server with Fast Refresh disabled:

```bash
npm run start:fix
```

2. **Updated Webpack Configuration**: We modified `config-overrides.js` to filter out React Refresh plugins when the `FAST_REFRESH=false` environment variable is set.

## Additional Options

If the issue persists, you can try these alternatives:

1. **Legacy Start with OpenSSL Legacy Provider**:
```bash
npm run start:legacy
```

2. **Clean and Restart**:
```bash
npm run clear-cache && npm run start:fix
```

3. **Build for Production**:
The production build doesn't use React Refresh, so it won't have these errors:
```bash
npm run build
```

## Notes for Development

- Disabling Fast Refresh means you'll need to manually refresh the browser to see code changes
- This is a development-only issue and doesn't affect production builds
- The userType issue has been fixed in the dataService, which was causing the inactive dashboard buttons
