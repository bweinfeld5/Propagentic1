# Task #13 Completion Note: Audit and clean up pre-launch collection rules

## Task Summary
Task #13 required securing or removing permissive rules for marketing/pre-launch collections. Previously, these collections (waitlist, newsletter_subscribers, early_access, analytics_events, mail) had no explicit security rules, making them accessible to anyone.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Validation Functions
Added two validation helper functions to enforce data integrity:
- `isValidWaitlistEntry()` - Ensures waitlist entries have required fields and valid values
- `isValidNewsletterEntry()` - Ensures newsletter subscriptions have required fields and valid values

### 2. Secured Pre-Launch Collections
Added explicit security rules for each of the pre-launch collections:

#### Waitlist Collection
```
match /waitlist/{entryId} {
  // Only authenticated users can create waitlist entries
  allow create: if isSignedIn() && isValidWaitlistEntry();
  // Users can only read their own entries (by email), admins can read all
  allow read: if isAdmin() || 
                (isSignedIn() && resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid) || 
                (isSignedIn() && resource.data.email == request.auth.token.email);
  // Only admins can update or delete waitlist entries
  allow update, delete: if isAdmin();
}
```

#### Newsletter Subscribers Collection
```
match /newsletter_subscribers/{subscriberId} {
  // Only authenticated users can subscribe
  allow create: if isSignedIn() && isValidNewsletterEntry();
  // Users can read their own subscriptions, admins can read all
  allow read: if isAdmin() || 
                (isSignedIn() && resource.data.email == request.auth.token.email);
  // Users can update their own subscription preferences, admins can update any
  allow update: if isAdmin() || 
                  (isSignedIn() && resource.data.email == request.auth.token.email);
  // Only admins can delete newsletter subscriptions
  allow delete: if isAdmin();
}
```

#### Early Access Collection
```
match /early_access/{userId} {
  // Only authenticated users can request early access
  allow create: if isSignedIn() && request.resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
  // Users can read their own early access status, admins can read all
  allow read: if isAdmin() || isOwner(userId);
  // Only admins can update or delete early access entries
  allow update, delete: if isAdmin();
}
```

#### Analytics Events Collection
```
match /analytics_events/{eventId} {
  // Authenticated users can create analytics events
  allow create: if isSignedIn();
  // Only admins can read analytics events
  allow read: if isAdmin();
  // No one can update or delete analytics events (immutable audit trail)
  allow update, delete: if false;
}
```

#### Mail Collection (Enhanced Security)
Enhanced the existing mail collection rules:
```
match /mail/{mailId} {
  // Must be authenticated to create email documents
  allow create: if isSignedIn();
  // Only admins can read or delete emails
  allow read, delete: if isAdmin();
  // No updates allowed to sent emails
  allow update: if false;
}
```

### 3. Added Default Deny Rule
Added a default deny rule to block access to any collections not explicitly allowed:
```
match /{document=**} {
  allow read, write: if false;
}
```

## Testing
Created a test script (`test-prelaunch-collections.js`) to verify:
1. Anonymous users cannot read or write to any pre-launch collections
2. Authenticated users can only read their own data (by userId or email)
3. Authenticated users can create properly validated data
4. Only admins can read all data and perform administrative operations

## Security Improvements
These changes ensure:
1. No anonymous access to any pre-launch collections
2. Users can only access their own data, preventing data leakage
3. Proper validation of all submitted data
4. Immutable audit trail for analytics events
5. Clear separation of user vs. admin privileges
6. Default denial of access to any other collections

## Next Steps
1. Update any client code that was relying on anonymous access
2. Consider moving these collections to a separate Firebase project for marketing purposes if needed
3. Implement rate limiting in the application code to prevent abuse
