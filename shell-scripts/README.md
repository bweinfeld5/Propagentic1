# Shell Scripts Directory

This directory contains all the shell scripts (`.sh` files) that were previously in the project root directory.

## üìÇ Organization

All shell scripts have been moved from the root directory to this `shell-scripts/` directory for better organization and cleaner project structure.

## üîß How Scripts Work

Each script has been modified to work correctly from this new location. At the beginning of every script, you'll find:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Navigate to project root directory
cd "$(dirname "$0")/.."
```

This command ensures that:
- **Relative paths work correctly** - All scripts continue to reference files relative to the project root
- **Scripts work from anywhere** - You can call these scripts from any directory and they'll still function
- **No path modifications needed** - The scripts maintain their original logic and file references

## üöÄ Usage

You can run any script in several ways:

### From Project Root
```bash
./shell-scripts/script-name.sh
```

### From Any Directory (using full path)
```bash
/path/to/project/shell-scripts/script-name.sh
```

### From Shell Scripts Directory
```bash
cd shell-scripts
./script-name.sh
```

All methods will work correctly because each script automatically navigates to the project root before executing.

## ‚úÖ Verification

To verify that scripts are working correctly:

1. **Test from project root:**
   ```bash
   ./shell-scripts/verify-components.sh
   ```

2. **Test from another directory:**
   ```bash
   cd /tmp
   /full/path/to/project/shell-scripts/verify-components.sh
   ```

Both should produce the same results, confirming that the scripts work regardless of the calling location.

## üîÑ Migration Notes

- **Before:** Scripts were in project root and assumed they were running from there
- **After:** Scripts are in `shell-scripts/` directory but automatically navigate to project root
- **Compatibility:** All scripts maintain their original functionality and interfaces
- **No breaking changes:** Existing usage patterns continue to work with updated paths

## üìù Script Modification Pattern

If you need to add new scripts to this directory, follow this pattern:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Navigate to project root directory
cd "$(dirname "$0")/.."

# Your script logic here...
# All relative paths will now work correctly
npm run build
firebase deploy
# etc.
```

This ensures consistency and proper functionality across all scripts.
