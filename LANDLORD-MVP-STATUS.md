# Landlord Dashboard Task Status

The original checklist in `LANDLORD-MVP-TASKS.md` tracks progress toward a functional landlord dashboard. Implementation in the repository shows all features completed except the final review/testing step.

## Completed
- Dashboard routing is verified and property loading errors were fixed.
- Empty state UI is present.
- Property management features (`AddPropertyModal`, `PropertyCard`, and property list display) are working.
- Tenant invitation UI and Firestore record creation via `createTenantInvite` are implemented.
- Mock data has been removed.

## Outstanding
- **Code Review & End-to-End Testing** remains unchecked in the task file and no dedicated tests are present.
