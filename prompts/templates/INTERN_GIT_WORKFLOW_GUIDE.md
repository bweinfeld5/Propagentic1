## üéØ **Overview**
This guide ensures your intern follows proper Git practices while keeping the main repository organized and preserving a clean development history for the Contractor Job Acceptance System project.

---

## üìã **Initial Setup (Day 1)**

### **1. Repository Access Setup**
```bash
# Mentor Action: Add intern as collaborator
# GitHub ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Manage access ‚Üí Invite a collaborator
# Permissions: Write access (not Admin)
```

### **2. Intern Environment Setup**
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Propagentic1.git
cd Propagentic1

# Set up git identity
git config user.name "Intern Full Name"
git config user.email "intern@propagentic.com"

# Set up upstream remote (if using fork workflow)
git remote add upstream https://github.com/yourusername/Propagentic1.git
```

### **3. Create Feature Branch Structure**
```bash
# Start from latest main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create main feature branch
git checkout -b feature/contractor-job-acceptance-intern

# Push initial branch
git push -u origin feature/contractor-job-acceptance-intern
```
