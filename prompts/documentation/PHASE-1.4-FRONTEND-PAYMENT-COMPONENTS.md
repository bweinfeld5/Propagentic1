## Component Integration Patterns

### 1. **Service Integration**
All components integrate with Firebase services:
```typescript
import EscrowService from '../../services/firestore/escrowService';
import DisputeService from '../../services/firestore/disputeService';
import PaymentService from '../../services/paymentService';
```

### 2. **Authentication Context**
Components use the auth context for user management:
```typescript
import { useAuth } from '../../context/AuthContext';
const { currentUser } = useAuth();
```

### 3. **UI Component Library**
Consistent use of reusable UI components:
```typescript
import Button from '../ui/Button';
import StatusPill from '../ui/StatusPill';
```

### 4. **Icon Library**
Heroicons for consistent iconography:
```typescript
import {
  BanknotesIcon,
  CreditCardIcon,
  ExclamationTriangleIcon
} from '@heroicons/react/24/outline';
```

## Data Flow Architecture

### State Management
- **Local State**: Component-level state using React hooks
- **Async Operations**: Proper loading states and error handling
- **Real-time Updates**: Components refresh data after mutations

### API Integration
- **Escrow Operations**: Create, update, release escrow accounts
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe integration for secure payments
- **Dispute Handling**: Real-time messaging and resolution workflows
- **File Uploads**: Evidence and documentation management

## Security Features

### 1. **Role-based Access Control**
- Components adapt functionality based on user role
- Landlord vs contractor specific features
- Action availability based on permissions

### 2. **Input Validation**
- Client-side validation for all forms
- Secure handling of payment information
- File upload restrictions and validation

### 3. **Data Sanitization**
- XSS prevention in user-generated content
- Secure file handling for evidence uploads
- Proper error message sanitization

## Responsive Design

### Mobile-First Approach

## Usage Examples

### Basic Implementation
```typescript
import { EscrowDashboard, PaymentsLayout } from '../components/payments';

function LandlordPayments() {
  return (
    <PaymentsLayout userRole="landlord">
      <EscrowDashboard userRole="landlord" />
    </PaymentsLayout>
  );
}
```

### Advanced Integration
```typescript
import { 
  PaymentMethodManager, 
  DisputeManager,
  EscrowDashboard 
} from '../components/payments';

function ContractorPaymentHub() {
  return (
    <PaymentsLayout userRole="contractor" initialTab="overview">
      <EscrowDashboard userRole="contractor" />
      <PaymentMethodManager onPaymentMethodAdded={handleNewPaymentMethod} />
      <DisputeManager userRole="contractor" />
    </PaymentsLayout>
  );
}
```
