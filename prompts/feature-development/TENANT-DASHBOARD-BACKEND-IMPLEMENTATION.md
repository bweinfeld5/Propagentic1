# Tenant Dashboard Backend Implementation

This document outlines the backend implementation completed to support the redesigned tenant dashboard. The implementation covers all the tasks specified in the TENANT-DASHBOARD-BACKEND-TASKS.md file.

## 1. Property Services

### Enhanced `getPropertyById()` Method
- Added comprehensive property details with formatted address string
- Added property photo URL extraction logic from multiple possible sources
- Implemented unit filtering based on tenant ID to show only relevant units
- Added property manager information retrieval
- Added property capacity calculation

### Added `getPropertiesForTenant()` Method
- Implemented multiple strategies to find properties associated with a tenant:
  - User profile property assignments
  - Property records with tenant references
  - Units containing the tenant
  - TenantProperties collection lookup
- Added comprehensive error handling and logging
- Implemented fallbacks if primary methods fail

## 2. Invitation Services

### Enhanced `getPendingInvitesForTenant()`
- Added property details to invitation objects:
  - Property name
  - Formatted address
  - Property photo URL
- Added property manager details:
  - Manager name
  - Manager contact information
- Added unit details to invitations when available

### Added `declineInvite()` Function
- Renamed `deleteInvite()` to `declineInvite()` for UI term consistency
- Maintained backward compatibility by having the new function call the original

## 3. Navigation Flow

### Added Navigation Service
- Created `navigationService.js` with standardized navigation functions:
  - `navigateToMaintenanceForm(navigate, propertyId, additionalState)`
  - `navigateToTenantDashboard(navigate)`
  - `navigateToMaintenanceDetail(navigate, ticketId)`
  - `navigateToPropertyDetail(navigate, propertyId)`

### Updated MaintenanceSurvey Component
- Added property selection support from route state
- Added multi-property selection UI
- Implemented proper routing back to tenant dashboard with success messages
- Enhanced form submission to include property details

## 4. Invite Code System

### Created Invite Code Schema
- Added `inviteCodes` collection with security rules
- Schema fields:
  - `code`: string (standardized to uppercase)
  - `propertyId`: string
  - `landlordId`: string
  - `unitId`: string (optional)
  - `expiresAt`: timestamp
  - `used`: boolean
  - `usedBy`: string (tenant ID)
  - `usedAt`: timestamp

### Added Firebase Function for Code Redemption
- Implemented `redeemInviteCode` Cloud Function
- Added validation for code format
- Added checks for:
  - Used codes
  - Expired codes
  - Property existence
  - User profile existence
- Used transactions for atomic updates across:
  - User profile
  - Property document
  - Unit management
  - Invite code status

### Added Client-Side Invite Code Service
- Implemented `inviteCodeService.js` with functions:
  - `validateInviteCode()`: Validate without redeeming
  - `redeemInviteCode()`: Call Cloud Function to redeem
  - `createInviteCode()`: Generate new codes for landlords
  - `getLandlordInviteCodes()`: Get all codes created by a landlord

### Added Security Rules
- Implemented rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
- Added rules for:
  - Reading invite codes (landlord or code verification)
  - Creating invite codes (landlords only)
  - Listing codes (landlord's own codes)
  - Updating codes (mark as used only, with atomicity checks)

## Testing Notes

To fully test this implementation, you should:

1. Test property retrieval with different tenant-property relationships
2. Verify invitation enhancement with manager details
3. Test navigation flows between tenant dashboard and maintenance form
4. Create and redeem invite codes to test the entire flow
5. Verify error handling for invalid or expired codes

## Next Steps

1. Create UI components for invite code entry
2. Add invite code management to landlord dashboard
3. Add detailed analytics for tracking code usage and conversions
4. Consider implementing email notifications when codes are generated or redeemed

## Dependencies

This implementation relies on:
- Firebase Functions for backend endpoints
- Firestore for data storage
- React Router for navigation
- Existing Tenant Dashboard UI components
