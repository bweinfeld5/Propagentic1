ðŸ”§ SENDGRID SENDER VERIFICATION GUIDE

To complete the email infrastructure setup, you need to verify sender emails in SendGrid:

STEP 1: Access SendGrid Dashboard
- Go to: https://app.sendgrid.com
- Log in with your SendGrid account

STEP 2: Navigate to Sender Authentication
- Click "Settings" in the left sidebar
- Click "Sender Authentication"

STEP 3: Verify Single Sender
- Click "Verify a Single Sender"
- Add email: noreply@propagentic.com
- Fill in the required information:
  * From Name: PropAgentic
  * From Email: noreply@propagentic.com
  * Reply To: support@propagentic.com
  * Company Address: Your company address
  * City, State, Zip: Your company location
  * Country: Your country

STEP 4: Check Email and Verify
- Check the email inbox for noreply@propagentic.com
- Click the verification link in the email
- Return to SendGrid dashboard to confirm verification

STEP 5: Optional - Add Additional Senders
- Repeat the process for: support@propagentic.com
- This provides a backup sender address

STEP 6: Test Email Sending
- Run: node .taskmaster/scripts/automation/sendgrid-setup.js test
- This will verify that emails can be sent successfully

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- If you don't have access to noreply@propagentic.com, use an email you control
- Update the sender email in functions/src/sendgridEmailService.ts
- Redeploy functions after making changes

Once verification is complete, the background agent will automatically detect the change and proceed with the next tasks.
