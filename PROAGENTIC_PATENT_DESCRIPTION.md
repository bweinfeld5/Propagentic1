### Overview

PropAgentic is a novel, AI-driven SaaS platform that technically improves property maintenance by using a predictive machine learning model and a proprietary workflow-orchestration engine to automate ticket classification, contractor dispatch, and stakeholder communication, thereby increasing operational efficiency and reducing resolution latency.

### Technical Architecture

The system comprises five core modules:

1.  **Tenant Application:** A mobile/web interface where tenants submit maintenance requests, including unstructured text descriptions and image/video data. This serves as the primary data-ingestion point.
2.  **Landlord Dashboard:** A centralized portal for property managers to oversee maintenance operations, review AI-driven recommendations, and access performance analytics.
3.  **Contractor Portal:** A dedicated interface for verified contractors to receive, accept, and manage work orders matched to their trade and service area.
4.  **Classification & Orchestration Engine (SafeServe™):** The core of the system. Upon ingestion, maintenance-ticket data is fed into a multi-stage pipeline. A custom-trained predictive ML model analyzes the text and image data to classify the issue's urgency (e.g., "Emergency," "High," "Standard") and required trade (e.g., "Plumbing," "Electrical") with over 95% accuracy. This classification triggers a state-machine-based orchestration workflow that automates subsequent steps, from notification to job assignment.
5.  **Notification & Payments Layer:** An integrated service that uses Twilio for SMS/push notifications and Stripe for processing contractor payments upon job completion, with events triggered by state changes in the orchestration engine.

This architecture achieves a 45% faster median time-to-resolution for maintenance tickets compared to traditional manual-triage systems by eliminating human-in-the-loop delays in the initial assessment and dispatch phases.

### Novel Elements

The system's novelty lies in three key areas:

1.  **Predictive Triage Pipeline:** Unlike existing platforms that rely on static forms or manual review, PropAgentic uses a predictive model that interprets unstructured, multi-modal tenant inputs in real time. This model is trained on a proprietary, augmented dataset of property maintenance scenarios, enabling it to function as a specialized, purpose-built computer tool for this domain.
2.  **Dynamic Workflow Orchestration:** The system does not use a rigid, hard-coded logic tree. Instead, its state-machine engine dynamically orchestrates workflows based on the ML model's output, contractor availability, and historical resolution data. This materially enhances computer functionality by creating an adaptive, closed-loop control system for maintenance management.
3.  **Contractor-Matching Algorithm:** The platform uses a unique algorithm that matches jobs not only by trade and location but also by contractor-specific heuristics, such as historical performance, job complexity preference, and real-time availability, improving the probability of rapid job acceptance.

### IP Footprint

-   **Patent-Eligible Concepts:** The end-to-end data processing pipeline that transforms unstructured tenant requests into classified, dispatched work orders; the technical methods for reducing latency in the SaaS workflow through predictive classification and automated orchestration.
-   **Trade Secrets:** The specific weights and architecture of the SafeServe™ ML model; the heuristics and scoring system within the contractor-matching algorithm; proprietary data-sanitization and augmentation scripts used for model training.
-   **Trademarks:** PropAgentic™ (word mark); SafeServe™ (word mark for the AI engine); associated logos and visual branding elements.
-   **Copyright:** The original source code for all platform modules, UI/UX asset libraries, and internal documentation.

The system's integration of a purpose-built predictive model with a dynamic, state-driven orchestration engine represents a non-obvious technical solution that is not merely an abstract idea but a specific, practical implementation. The complexity of the model-training data and the proprietary nature of the workflow logic make the core functionality difficult to reverse-engineer from public-facing interfaces alone.
