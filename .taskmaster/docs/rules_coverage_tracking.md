# Firestore Rules Coverage Tracking Implementation

## Overview

This document details the implementation of Task #12: "Implement rules coverage tracking in CI". The system now tracks coverage metrics for Firestore security rules tests, enforces coverage thresholds, and displays coverage information through badges and reports.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Jest Configuration

The Jest configuration has been updated to enable coverage tracking for Firestore rules:

- **Coverage Collection**: Configured to collect coverage metrics for the `firestore.rules` file
- **Coverage Thresholds**: Set minimum thresholds of 90% for lines, functions, statements, and branches
- **Coverage Reporters**: Added multiple report formats including text, LCOV, JSON, and HTML
- **Coverage Directory**: Reports are saved to `test-reports/coverage/`

### 2. NPM Scripts

Added dedicated scripts to package.json for running tests with coverage:

- `test:rules:coverage`: Runs all Firestore rules tests with coverage reporting
- `emulators:test:rules:coverage`: Runs tests with coverage in the Firebase emulator

### 3. GitHub Actions Integration

Enhanced the CI workflow for Firestore rules tests with coverage capabilities:

- **Coverage Execution**: Modified GitHub Actions workflow to run tests with coverage
- **Artifact Publishing**: Configured to upload coverage reports as workflow artifacts
- **Badge Generation**: Added coverage badge generation for the main branch
- **Threshold Enforcement**: Added script to verify coverage meets the 90% threshold

### 4. Coverage Badge

Added a dynamic coverage badge to the README.md file that:

- Displays the current line coverage percentage
- Updates automatically when new coverage reports are generated
- Links to the GitHub Actions workflow for more details

## Coverage Metrics

The system tracks the following coverage metrics:

- **Line Coverage**: Percentage of lines in the rules file executed by tests
- **Statement Coverage**: Percentage of statements executed
- **Function Coverage**: Percentage of functions called
- **Branch Coverage**: Percentage of branches (if/else paths) covered

## Usage Guidelines

### Running Coverage Locally

To run coverage tests locally:

```bash
# Start Firebase emulator and run tests with coverage
npm run emulators:test:rules:coverage

# View the coverage report
open test-reports/coverage/index.html
```

### Interpreting Coverage Reports

The HTML report provides a detailed breakdown of coverage by rule/function:

- **Green**: Lines that are fully covered by tests
- **Yellow**: Branches where only some conditions are tested
- **Red**: Lines not covered by any tests

### Maintaining Coverage Standards

To maintain the required 90% coverage standard:

1. Write tests for any new rules or functions added
2. Ensure both positive and negative test cases (allow/deny) for each rule
3. Test edge cases and boundary conditions
4. Focus on testing complex conditional logic thoroughly

## Benefits

- **Early Detection**: Finds untested rules before deployment
- **Documentation**: Serves as living documentation of rule behavior
- **Confidence**: Provides assurance of security rule completeness
- **Visibility**: Makes coverage metrics transparent to the team

## Future Improvements

- Integrate coverage reporting with code review tools
- Add per-collection coverage metrics
- Expand test suite to cover more edge cases
- Implement test mutation to verify test quality
