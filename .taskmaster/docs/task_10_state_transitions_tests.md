# Task #10: Implement Tests for State Machine Transitions

## Overview

This task involved implementing comprehensive tests for state machine transitions in PropAgentic's Firestore security rules. The tests ensure that state transitions (status changes) are properly enforced, with valid transitions allowed and invalid transitions rejected based on user roles and current state.

## Test Coverage

The test suite is organized into distinct test groups covering different state machines in the system:

### Invite Status Transitions
- Verified that tenants can accept invites sent to their email (status: pending → accepted)
- Confirmed that tenants cannot accept invites meant for other users
- Tested that landlords can revoke their own invites (status: pending → revoked)
- Ensured landlords cannot change invites to invalid statuses
- Verified tenants cannot revoke invites (they can only accept)
- Confirmed admins can change invite status to any valid value
- Tested that once an invite is accepted, it cannot be changed back to pending

### Newsletter Subscription Status Transitions
- Verified users can unsubscribe from their own newsletter subscriptions (status: active → unsubscribed)
- Confirmed users cannot change someone else's subscription status
- Tested that admins can mark subscriptions as bounced (status: active → bounced)
- Ensured users cannot set invalid subscription status values

### Ticket Status Transitions
- Verified property owners can update ticket status
- Confirmed tenants who submitted tickets can update their status
- Tested that other tenants cannot update tickets they didn't submit
- Ensured admins can update any ticket status

### Placeholder for Future State Machines
- Added a framework for testing escrow status transitions when that functionality is implemented

## Implementation Details

1. **Test Structure**:
   - Each state machine has its own describe block
   - Tests within each block follow the pattern of testing valid transitions, invalid transitions, and role-based permissions

2. **Test Data Setup**:
   - Created test users with different roles (landlord, tenant, admin)
   - Set up test documents with initial status values
   - Configured relationships between users and documents

3. **Transition Tests**:
   - Each test attempts to perform a specific state transition
   - Assertions verify if the transition should succeed or fail
   - Multiple roles are tested against each transition

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Tested status changes on documents that have already been transitioned
   - Verified users cannot set invalid status values
   - Ensured transitions respect proper sequencing (no going backwards in workflow)

## Security Findings

The tests confirm that PropAgentic's Firestore rules properly implement:

1. **Status Validation**: Only valid status values are accepted
2. **Transition Control**: Only valid state transitions are allowed
3. **Role-Based Permissions**: Different user roles have appropriate transition privileges
4. **Document Ownership**: Users can only perform transitions on documents they own or are associated with
5. **Admin Override**: Administrators have the ability to perform any valid transition

## Running the Tests

Tests can be run with the Firebase emulator using the following command:

```bash
npm run emulators:test:state-transitions
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Escrow Status Transitions**: When implemented, the escrow system will need comprehensive transition tests between states like 'created', 'funded', 'in_progress', 'disputed', 'released', and 'refunded'.

2. **Dispute Resolution Workflow**: The dispute resolution process will have its own state machine with transitions that should be tested.

3. **Contractor Onboarding Status**: As contractor onboarding is implemented, transitions between states like 'invited', 'registered', 'verified', and 'active' should be tested.

## Conclusion

The state machine transition tests provide confidence that PropAgentic's workflow rules are properly enforced at the database level. By thoroughly testing status transitions across various collections, we ensure that document states follow the correct business logic and can only be modified by authorized users in valid ways.
