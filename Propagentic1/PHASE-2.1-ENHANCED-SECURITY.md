# Phase 2.1 Enhanced Security Implementation

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive security infrastructure for PropAgentic, providing enterprise-grade protection against common attack vectors and security threats. The implementation includes 5 core security services that work together to create a robust defense system.

## üîê Security Services Implemented

- Automatic blocking with exponential backoff
- Memory-efficient sliding window algorithm
- Global emergency mode for threat response

**Key Protections**:
- Login attempts: 5 attempts per 15 minutes (production)
- Signup attempts: 3 attempts per hour
- Password reset: 3 attempts per hour
- API requests: 100 requests per 15 minutes

**Purpose**: Prevents XSS, SQL injection, and other input-based attacks

**Features**:
- Real-time XSS detection and sanitization
- SQL injection pattern detection
- Comprehensive password policy enforcement
- Email validation with domain checking
- HTML tag filtering and content sanitization

**Validation Rules**:
- Password: Minimum 8 characters, must include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters
- Email: Format validation, domain verification, disposable email blocking
- Input length limits and character restrictions

### 3. Audit Logging Service (`auditLogger.js`)
**Purpose**: Tracks all sensitive operations for compliance and security monitoring

**Features**:
- Comprehensive event categorization (authentication, data access, financial, security)
- Automatic data retention policies (7 years for financial, 1 year for security)
- Real-time security alerts for critical events

**Event Types Logged**:
- Authentication events (login, logout, 2FA, password changes)
- Data access (view, create, update, delete operations)
- Payment and escrow transactions
- Security violations and suspicious activities
- System maintenance and errors

### 4. Two-Factor Authentication Service (`twoFactorAuth.js`)
**Purpose**: Adds multi-factor authentication for enhanced account security

**Features**:
- TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) support
- QR code generation for authenticator apps
- 10 backup codes for account recovery
- Rate limiting on verification attempts
- Device fingerprinting and validation

**Implementation**:
- 6-digit codes with 30-second time windows
- Support for Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.
- Backup codes for emergency access
- Optional requirement for sensitive operations

### 5. Session Management Service (`sessionManager.js`)
**Purpose**: Secure token handling and automatic logout management

**Features**:
- Automatic session timeout (30 minutes inactivity, 8 hours maximum)
- Device fingerprinting for security validation
- Concurrent session limits (3-5 sessions per user)
- Real-time activity monitoring
- Session extension and warning system

**Security Measures**:
- Encrypted session storage
- Device validation on each request
- Automatic cleanup of expired sessions
- Session hijacking detection

## üõ°Ô∏è Enhanced AuthContext Integration

Created `EnhancedAuthContext.jsx` that integrates all security services:

**Features**:
- Unified authentication with security checks
- Automatic rate limiting enforcement
- Input sanitization on all auth operations
- Comprehensive audit logging
- 2FA enforcement and management
- Session security monitoring

**Usage**:
```jsx
import { useEnhancedAuth } from '../context/EnhancedAuthContext';

function LoginComponent() {
  const { login, verify2FA, securityStatus } = useEnhancedAuth();
  
  // All authentication operations now include:
  // - Rate limiting
  // - Input sanitization
  // - Audit logging
  // - 2FA support
  // - Session management
}
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Management

### Security Configuration (`securityConfig.js`)
Centralized configuration for all security settings:

**Environment-Specific Settings**:
- Development: More lenient limits for testing
- Production: Strict security measures
- Test: Minimal restrictions for automated testing

**Configurable Parameters**:
- Rate limiting thresholds
- Session timeouts and limits
- Password policy requirements
- 2FA settings
- Audit retention periods
- Security monitoring intervals

### Unified Security Manager (`index.js`)
Single interface for all security services:

**Features**:
- Automatic initialization of all services
- Threat level assessment and response
- Security health monitoring
- Emergency lockdown capabilities
- Comprehensive security reporting

## üìä Security Monitoring & Alerting

### Real-Time Threat Detection
- Continuous monitoring of security metrics
- Automatic threat level assessment (low, medium, high, critical)
- Dynamic security measure adjustment based on threat level
- Emergency lockdown for critical threats

### Security Metrics Tracked
- Failed login attempts
- Rate limiting violations
- Suspicious activities
- Security attack attempts
- Session violations
- System health indicators

### Automated Responses
- **Low Threat**: Normal security measures
- **Medium Threat**: Slightly restrictive rate limits
- **High Threat**: Enhanced security (30% stricter limits)
- **Critical Threat**: Maximum security (90% stricter limits)

## üîç Compliance Features

### GDPR Compliance
- Right to erasure support
- Data portability features
- Consent management
- Automatic data anonymization

### Financial Compliance
- 7-year data retention for financial records
- Audit trails for all transactions
- Data integrity validation
- PCI compliance features

## üìà Performance Optimizations

### Efficient Implementation
- Memory-efficient rate limiting algorithms
- Batched audit logging (100 events per batch)
- Optimized session validation
- Minimal performance impact on user experience

### Resource Management
- Automatic cleanup of expired data
- Configurable retention policies
- Background maintenance tasks
- Resource usage monitoring

  ip: userIP
});

if (result.requiresTwoFactor) {
  // Handle 2FA verification
  const verification = await verify2FA(twoFactorCode);
}
```

### Security Status Monitoring
```jsx
const securityStatus = getSecurityStatus();
console.log('Threat Level:', securityStatus.threatLevel);
console.log('Active Sessions:', securityStatus.sessionStats);
console.log('Rate Limit Status:', securityStatus.rateLimitStatus);
```

### Emergency Security Actions
```jsx
// Emergency lockdown
await securityManager.emergencyLockdown('security_incident');

// Get security report
const report = await securityManager.generateSecurityReport('daily');
```
