# Task #5: Implement Tests for /users Collection Rules

## Overview

This task involved implementing comprehensive tests for the Firestore security rules protecting the `/users` collection. The tests verify that our security rules correctly enforce the role-based access control policies and prevent unauthorized modifications, especially to sensitive fields like `userType` and `role`.

## Test Coverage

The test suite covers the following security aspects:

### Read Operations
- Verified that users can read their own profile documents
- Confirmed users cannot read other users' profiles
- Ensured admins can read any user profile
- Verified that no one (including admins) can list all users at once through collection-level queries

### Create Operations
- Confirmed users can create their own profile documents
- Verified users cannot create documents for other users
- Tested that even admins cannot create user documents for others (this should be handled by Firebase Auth)

### Update Operations
- Verified users can update non-sensitive fields in their own documents
- Confirmed users cannot update another user's document
- Tested that users cannot update their own `userType` or `role` fields
- Verified that users cannot perform sneaky updates that mix allowed fields with sensitive fields
- Confirmed admins can update any field on any user document

### Delete Operations
- Verified users cannot delete their own profile documents
- Confirmed users cannot delete other users' documents
- Tested that even admins cannot directly delete user documents (this should be handled through Firebase Auth)

### Edge Cases
- Confirmed unauthenticated users cannot read any user documents
- Verified unauthenticated users cannot create user documents
- Tested that a user cannot change their role from tenant to admin
- Confirmed users can submit updates that include role/userType fields as long as they don't change values

## Implementation Details

1. **Test Utilities**: Used our new test helpers from Task #4 to simplify test setup
2. **Test Data**: Created various user types (tenant, landlord, admin) to test different permissions
3. **Test Structure**: Organized tests into logical groups by operation type
4. **Edge Cases**: Added specific tests for edge cases and potential security bypasses

## Running the Tests

Tests can be run with the Firebase emulator using the following command:

```bash
npm run emulators:test:users
```

## Security Findings

The tests confirm that our Firestore rules for the `/users` collection properly implement:

1. **Field-level security** that prevents users from escalating their privileges
2. **Document-level access control** that restricts reads to only authorized users
3. **Proper admin privileges** that allow system administrators to manage user accounts
4. **Creation and deletion restrictions** that align with Firebase Auth's role

## Conclusion

The comprehensive test suite provides confidence that our security rules for user data are robust and correctly implemented. These tests serve as both verification and documentation of our security model for user data access.
