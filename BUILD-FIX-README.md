## Issue: React Fast Refresh Runtime Errors in Production Build

The build process was failing with the following errors:

```
ERROR in ./src/pages/***.jsx
Module not found: Error: You attempted to import /Users/benweinfeld/Desktop/Propagentic/node_modules/react-refresh/runtime.js 
which falls outside of the project src/ directory. Relative imports outside of src/ are not supported.
```

This was occurring because the build process was automatically injecting references to React Fast Refresh, which is only meant for development mode but was being incorrectly included in production builds.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced config-overrides.js

Updated the Webpack configuration to completely disable React Fast Refresh by:

- Filtering out the ReactRefreshPlugin
- Removing react-refresh/runtime.js references from entry points
- Removing babel plugins related to react-refresh
- Setting environment variables to disable Fast Refresh

```javascript
// config-overrides.js (key parts)
(config) => {
  // --- Disable React Fast Refresh regardless of environment ---
  console.log("Disabling React Fast Refresh for all builds");
  
  // 1. Filter out the ReactRefreshPlugin
  config.plugins = config.plugins.filter(
    plugin => !plugin.constructor || plugin.constructor.name !== 'ReactRefreshPlugin'
  );
  
  // 2. Remove react-refresh/runtime.js from entry points
  if (config.entry) {
    // Code to filter entry points
  }
  
  // 3. Remove any babel plugins related to react-refresh
  if (config.module && config.module.rules) {
    // Code to filter babel plugins
  }

  // Define environment variables to disable Fast Refresh
  config.plugins.push(
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
      'process.env.FAST_REFRESH': JSON.stringify(false),
      '__REACT_REFRESH_RUNTIME__': 'false',
    })
  );
}
```

### 2. Added Fixed Build Script

Added a new npm script that explicitly disables Fast Refresh:

```json
"build:fixed": "cross-env FAST_REFRESH=false DISABLE_ESLINT_PLUGIN=true GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false NODE_OPTIONS=\"--max_old_space_size=4096 --openssl-legacy-provider\" react-app-rewired build"
```

## How to Build the Project

Use one of these commands:

1. For the fixed build with React Fast Refresh explicitly disabled:
   ```
   npm run build:fixed
   ```

2. Alternative builds (if needed):
   ```
   npm run build:safe     # Uses react-scripts directly
   npm run build:clean    # Uses a custom build script
   ```

## Testing the Build

To test if the build was successful:

```
npx serve -s build
```

Then navigate to http://localhost:3000 and verify that the application loads without any console errors related to react-refresh.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by the `react-app-rewired` configuration which wasn't properly disabling React Fast Refresh in production builds. The webpack configuration was conditionally disabling it only when `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'development'`, but this condition was not being properly evaluated or respected during the build process.

The fix ensures that Fast Refresh is disabled regardless of the environment, which is appropriate for production builds.
