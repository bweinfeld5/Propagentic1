# OpenSSL Compatibility Fix Tasks

## Issue Summary
The build process is failing with multiple errors:

1. **OpenSSL Error**: `Error: error:0308010C:digital envelope routines::unsupported`
   - This is caused by Node.js 18+ using OpenSSL 3.0, which is incompatible with webpack in create-react-app.

2. **Dependency Conflicts**: 
   - React Router DOM error: `Cannot find module: 'react-router/dom'`
   - Framer Motion error: `Can't import the named export 'Children' from non EcmaScript module`

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. ✅ Added OpenSSL Legacy Provider Flag
- Updated npm scripts in package.json to use the OpenSSL legacy provider.
- Created a build helper script (`scripts/build-openssl-fix.js`) to set the required environment variables.

### 2. ✅ Fixed React Router DOM Version
- Downgraded react-router-dom from v7.5.0 to v6.3.0 to fix compatibility issues.
- Added a convenience script `fix-router` to perform this operation.

### 3. ✅ Fixed Framer Motion Version
- Downgraded framer-motion from v12.6.5 to v6.5.1 for better compatibility.
- Added a convenience script `fix-framer` to perform this operation.

### 4. ✅ Added Documentation
- Created documentation in `NODEJS-OPENSSL-README.md` about the OpenSSL issue and solutions.

## Remaining Issues

While we've fixed the OpenSSL error, we're still encountering build issues related to module compatibility:

1. **Framer Motion ESModule Imports**:
   - Error: `Can't import the named export 'Children' from non EcmaScript module`
   - This suggests deeper compatibility issues between the React version (19.1.0) and framer-motion.

2. **TypeScript Version Warning**:
   - Warning about using an unsupported TypeScript version (5.8.3) with typescript-estree.

## Next Steps

To resolve the remaining issues, we need to:

1. **Downgrade React**: 
   - Consider downgrading React from v19.1.0 to v18.2.0 for better compatibility with framer-motion and other dependencies.
   - Update the "resolutions" field in package.json to enforce consistent versions.

2. **Create a Consolidated Fix Script**:
   - Create a single script that applies all compatibility fixes in the correct order.
   - Include checking and fixing TypeScript version if needed.

3. **Consider Alternative Bundlers**:
   - Evaluate whether migrating from create-react-app to a more modern bundler like Vite would avoid these issues.

## Execution Plan

1. Modify package.json to downgrade React and related dependencies
2. Create a comprehensive dependency fix script
3. Test the build process with all fixes applied
4. Document the complete solution for future reference
