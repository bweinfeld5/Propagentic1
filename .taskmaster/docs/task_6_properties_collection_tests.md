# Task #6: Implement Tests for /properties Collection Rules

## Overview

This task involved implementing comprehensive tests for the Firestore security rules protecting the `/properties` collection. The tests verify that our security rules correctly enforce access controls based on user roles and property ownership, with a particular focus on query rules, filtering, and limits.

## Test Coverage

The test suite is organized into distinct test groups covering different types of operations:

### Single Document Operations
- Verified landlords can read their own properties but not others'
- Confirmed tenants can read properties they're associated with (via both direct `propertyId` and `properties` array)
- Tested that property managers can read properties they manage
- Ensured admins can read any property
- Verified unauthenticated users cannot read any property

### Create Operations
- Confirmed landlords can create properties with their own ID
- Verified landlords cannot create properties with another landlord's ID
- Tested that admins can create properties with any landlord ID
- Ensured tenants and property managers cannot create properties

### Update Operations
- Verified landlords can update their own properties but not others'
- Confirmed property managers can update properties they manage
- Tested that property managers cannot update the `landlordId` field
- Ensured tenants cannot update any property
- Verified admins can update any property, including changing landlord ownership

### Delete Operations
- Confirmed landlords can delete their own properties but not others'
- Verified tenants and property managers cannot delete properties
- Ensured admins can delete any property

### Query Operations (Focus Area)
- Verified landlord queries must include a `landlordId` filter matching their ID
- Confirmed landlord queries respect the Firebase default limit of 100 documents
- Tested that admins can query properties without filters
- Ensured tenants can only query properties they're associated with
- Verified property managers can only query properties they manage

### Validation
- Tested that property creation requires all mandatory fields

## Implementation Details

1. **Test Data Setup**: 
   - Created multiple test users with different roles (landlord, tenant, property manager, admin)
   - Generated over 100 properties to test query limits
   - Established relationships between users and properties (ownership, tenancy, management)

2. **Query Testing Focus**:
   - Implemented specific tests for query filtering requirements
   - Verified query limits to prevent excessive data retrieval
   - Tested both valid and invalid query patterns for each user role

3. **Role-Based Access Testing**:
   - Thoroughly tested the different access levels for each user role
   - Verified that security rules correctly enforce the principle of least privilege

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Tested property associations through both direct IDs and array relationships
   - Verified property managers' limited update capabilities
   - Ensured ownership checks prevent cross-landlord access

## Security Findings

The tests confirm that our Firestore rules for the `/properties` collection properly implement:

1. **Ownership-based access control** that restricts landlords to their own properties
2. **Association-based tenant access** that limits tenants to properties they rent
3. **Manager capabilities** that allow updates but not creation or deletion
4. **Admin privileges** that provide complete access control
5. **Query safety** that prevents unauthorized data access through queries
6. **Query limits** that protect against excessive data retrieval

## Running the Tests

Tests can be run with the Firebase emulator using the following command:

```bash
npm run emulators:test:properties
```

## Conclusion

The comprehensive test suite provides confidence that our security rules for property data are robust and correctly implemented. These tests ensure that property data is securely managed with appropriate access controls for different user roles, preventing unauthorized access or modifications while allowing legitimate operations to proceed.
